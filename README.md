# nebulith.org
## Description
Nebulith or nebulith.org is a complete rebuild and rebranding of my previous web project, spatialflunky.one
## Purpose
It was apparent that development on the old spatialflunky.one had stagnated and was going nowhere. This site will focus on many of the same goals and expand on them by implementing a greater range of functionality (ex. adding more projects) with a completely renewed design and style.
## Todo list for rebuild (backend specific):
- [x] Move spatialflunky.one source code to this repository
- [x] Refactor Flask HTML templates to be efficient and modular (ex. split HTML content into parts to be assembled)
## Todo list for new features:
- [x] Redesign and implement new theme based on the old (no longer used) space age theme from winworldpc.com
  - Theme can be viewed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20160313224804/https://winworldpc.com/)
- [x] Integrate a login system
- [x] Integrate the login system with a real database
- [ ] Create account management page
- [ ] Create way for admin user to create new users
- [x] Create about page
- [x] Add content to the homepage
- [ ] Create photo gallery
- [ ] Completely rework "downloads" page
- [ ] Create forum
- [ ] Create blog
- [ ] Create IRC
