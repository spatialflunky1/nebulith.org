            <p>Nebulith (or nebulith.org) started off as a pet project back in 2020 under a different name during the beginning of the COVID pandemic.</p>
            <p>It began when I decided to start my web development journey with a new project site, “spatialflunky1.github.io”. I was fresh out of middle school at the time and wanted to test my (poor) skills at software development by starting a website to store all of my various projects. At the time, and being the teenager that I was, I was inspired by the ability for sites to have a version listing of their programs and a link to downloads and changelogs for each. Because of this, the main purpose of the new site was simply to list my most worked on software project and all of its various download links. This site was extremely poorly made and entirely in HTML, with a few lines of CSS only adding text color and spacing. At the time, I believed that my website looked “good” and was satisfactory to only my own needs. As time went on, however, I started to realize more and more that my purely static website that contained ever-updating links for a project was inefficient and required a much-needed facelift.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I had figured out how to purchase a domain and thus began “spatialflunky.one”. While migrating to this new domain, I realized that my site desperately needed a design touch-up. The best way that I could think of designing a webpage at the time was to open firealpaca and get to drawing. If anyone has seen the original site, or goes to the web archive and looks at it, you can really tell that I just had two sections of the site (sidebar and title) where I just took a really thick brush to make a line and then just decreased the size and filled it in to get a round-border rectangle. It was quick and dirty, but it got the job done and looked marginally better than it did the first go-around.</p>
            <p>During the lifespan of this website, it had turned from being just as it originally was, with only being static and hosting download links to a single program, to a complete rewrite in Python Flask that was used mainly to serve me music in a homebrew music player kind of way. The music player was one of my biggest features on the site, with me creating script after script to help me automate the process of going from CD album to digital MP3 format, laid out specifically for the site.</p>
            <p>During this time, however, I came to the realization that I was hosting copyrighted music on a public platform, which made me quickly shut the music department down. With the main feature of the site gone, I noticed that my website was hanging on by a thread. The codebase was sloppy and heavily outdated; it only contained a single feature to display my GitHub links, and the theme of the site was extremely poorly made. To put the cherry on top, every page had a background that was an image with a way too high resolution, which bogged loading times down heavily.</p>
            <p>Around September of this year (2025), I gained the motivation and decided it was time to give this site another life. I started by attempting to move my domain from Squarespace (which started off on Google Domains) to Cloudflare. This was the first hurdle that needed to be overcome. I found out during my switching of registrars that Cloudflare did not have any control over the dot one top-level domain. This put an immediate wrench in my plans as I could no longer keep my previous domain and needed to brainstorm a name that had not been taken already. It took a couple of days to get a name down that would stick that hadn’t already been taken, but with my love of space and space-related themes, I decided on nebulith.org.</p>
            <p>With this new Cloudflare domain in hand, I drafted up a timeline and got to work on the new site. The first big challenge of the new site was to refactor all of my previous Python Flask code and modularize the entire website. After this, I needed to come up with a new theme for the site to replace the low-effort theme I came up with. If you were a frequent browser of old archived Windows versions, then you might realize that the theme that is displayed on this site is one that closely resembles that of the old WinWorld theme from around ~2016. I had taken great inspiration from that old site and wanted to continue its legacy after it removed the theme around that same time.</p>
            <p>With the theme in place, all that needed to be done was finish the rest of the underlying features and integrate them with the new sub-projects of the site. And thus, nebulith.org was created.</p>
